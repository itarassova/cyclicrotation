# cyclicrotation
Cyclic Rotation task on Codility

Rotate an array A containing N elements so that each element is shifted to the right K times, the last element is moved over to the first place in the array.
Assume that N and K are integers within the range [0..100] and each element of the array A is an integer within the range [-1000..1000]. 
the focus is on the correctness of the solution, the performance is not assessed.
